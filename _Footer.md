_**Tesseract Wiki**_
HI I have generated the traineddata and unicharset files from jtessboxEditor.
However when I used it on 
training/combine_tessdata -d traineddata 
It is not giving me the net_specs for the traineddata, it just gives me the version number.

Again I tried to create the traineddata from scratch, but it ran an error from saying that Unable to load the scripts directory.

I am new to Deeplearning. Hoping for your support in this regard
